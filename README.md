# 🏎️ Bigger Than Race

A racing game that teaches number comparison. Two cars pull up with different amounts of fuel — tap the one with more to watch it zoom to the finish line!

Built for a 3-year-old who can count past 100 but is still building intuition for "which number is bigger?"

## How It Works

- Two cars appear with numbers and visible fuel gauges
- Tap the car with the **bigger number** (more fuel)
- The winner races to the checkered flag 🏁
- Get 5 in a row to level up!

## Levels

| Level | Range | What it teaches |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| Easy Peasy | 1–9 | Single digit comparison |
| Getting Tricky | 1–20 | Teens vs single digits |
| Big Numbers! | 10–50 | Two-digit comparison |
| Super Racer | 10–100 | Wider two-digit range |
| Number Champion | 50–200 | Three-digit introduction |
| MEGA BRAIN | 100–500 | Three-digit comparison |
| ULTIMATE! | 100–999 | Full three-digit range |
